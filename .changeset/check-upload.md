Add `groundrule check --upload`: sends the result of a check to your organization on Groundrule, with the repository, commit, and, in GitHub Actions, the pull request it was for (RFC 0005, new `CheckRun` document kind and JSON Schema). Snippets are one redacted line per finding, never for security rules, and `--no-snippets` sends none. A failed upload never changes the check's exit code. The GitHub Action gains `token`, `snippets` and `url` inputs to turn it on.
