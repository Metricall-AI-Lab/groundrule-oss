# @groundrule/spec

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 2ee2e56: Connect repositories to the Groundrule platform: `groundrule login` (browser approval), `whoami`, `logout`, and `init --org`. With `platform:` in the config, `sync` writes your organization's rules at Teach and above, and `check` runs Enforce rules as set and Advise rules as warnings. `GROUNDRULE_TOKEN` works in CI.
- ddf5aef: Add `groundrule scan`: observe a repository against the whole catalog without changing anything. Reports the stack, existing agent instruction files, tool configurations, and how every applicable rule would do today. `--json` prints the report (new `ScanReport` spec kind), `--upload` shares it with your organization, `--no-snippets` leaves code out.
- b4757b4: `groundrule scan` imports what a repository already has as proposals: instructions from agent files (split by heading and list item, de-duplicated, matched to similar catalog rules), linter and compiler settings that enforce catalog rules, and CODEOWNERS entries. `--no-import` leaves them out.
